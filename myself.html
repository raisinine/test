          <p>My name is Sihoon, I am currently 15 and live in Germany.<br>It's safe to say I am an indoors guy. I like sports and all, but my nice, warm room is better than anything (well, most things.)<br>
             I generally like learning and trying new things, I keep trying new things, but somehow get fed up with them fairly quickly, I'll try to stick with the channel:-)<br>
             I was born in Seungnam City in Korea in 2005 and grew up there until 2011. the thingis I don't remember much of Korea back then, since I was so young and little.
